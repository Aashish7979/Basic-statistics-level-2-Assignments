WebSideStory claims that its sample includes all the daily Internet users. If that’s the case, then can Microsoft conclude that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the market?We are given that WebSideStory claims that its sample includes all the daily Internet users. This means that the 4.6% is the population percentage. Comparing it with Microsoft's claim that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the whole market is True. Hence, we can conclude that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the market."
